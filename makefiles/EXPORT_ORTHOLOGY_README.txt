Orthologs between various fly species.

Andreas Heger and Chris Ponting (2006)

Citation: This work has not been published yet. 

Method: 

Orthologs are predicted for each pair of Drosophila species
using a pipeline written by Leo Goodstadt [1].

References:

[1] Goodstadt L, Ponting P (unpublished)

Output format:

Orthology predictions for each fly genome are in separate files. The files
are in GFF3 format (see http://song.sourceforge.net/gff3.shtml). The
coordinates are identical to those found in the ../aaa directory.
