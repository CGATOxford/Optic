Gene predictions for various fly genomes. 

Andreas Heger and Chris Ponting (2006)

Citation: This work has not been published yet. 

Method: 

Genes are predicted by homology using transcripts from D. melanogaster and
a pipeline based on exonerate [1].

Output format:

Gene predictions for each fly genome are in separate files. The files
are in GFF3 format (see http://song.sourceforge.net/gff3.shtml) according
to the rules laid out in the AAAWiki 
(see http://rana.lbl.gov/drosophila/wiki/index.php/Annotation_Coordination)

Files in this release:

[assembly].gff: gff3 files including the features gene, mRNA and CDS.
