---++ Overview of file contents

All files are tab-separated input with a header. Lines starting with "#"
are comments and should be ignored.

---+++ Input files

%.gtf: gtf formatted input files of transcribed loci.

In additition, there are the following columns denoting the overlap of the transcript with
various features on the genome. These columns are labelled

[count]:[feature]:[location]

[count] can be either one of
nover1	number of exons overlapping a certain feature
nover2	number of features overlapping with exons
nover	number of residues overlapping
pover1  percent residue overlap of exons 
pover2  percent residue overlap of features

[feature] can be empty or either one of
protein_coding
pseudogene

[location] can be either one of
UTR	       any UTR
UTR3	       3' UTR
UTR5	       5' UTR
CDS	       coding part of a reference gene
exon	       exon of a reference gene (CDS + UTR)
intron	       intron of a reference gene
intergenic     space between reference gene
flank	       within 1kb of a reference gene
3flank	       within 1kb of the 3' end of a reference gene
5flank	       within 1kb of the 5' end of a reference gene
telomeric      genomic region before/after first/last exon on a chromosome

---++++ Overlap

Detailed overlap statistics are computed using an exon by exon comparison
and a gene by gene comparison. The former are files ending in %.diff, the
latter in files ending in %_genes.diff.

---+++++ %.diff

Overlap of a reference gene with transcripts. The columns are

Column	   Content
gene_id	   gene id in reference set
contig	   contig
strand	   strand
nval	   number of exons in reference gene
min	   minimum exon length
max	   maximum exon length
mean	   mean exon length
median	   median exon length
stddev	   standard deviation of exon length
sum	   sum of exon lengths (transcript length)
q1	   first quartile of exon length
q3	   third quartile of exon length
nover1	   number of exons in reference gene overlapping exons in transcript set
nover2	   number of exons in transcript set overlapping exons in refererence set
nover	   number of bases overlapping
pover1	   percent residue overlap of reference gene
pover2	   percent residue overlap of overlapping exons in transcript set

----++++ %.diff.{diff,overlap,total}

Detailed exon overlap.

----++++ %.diff.genes_{ovl,total,uniq1,uniq2}

These tables contain lists of overlapping genes and summary statistics of the overlap.

   * %.diff.genes_ovl lists pairs of overlapping genes. This is a m:m relationship. 
   * %.diff.genes_total gives a summary of the overlap
   * %.diff.uniq1 genes in the reference gene set that do not overlap 
   * %.diff.uniq2 genes in the transcript gene set that do not overlap
